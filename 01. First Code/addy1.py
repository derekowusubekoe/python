# That's enough
# - Let's write a program
# - Ask the user for two numbers, and add them
# - Do it on paper
# - NO CODE!
# - Algorithm only


    # Mine Algorithm
# - Create two variables to store the value, num1 and num2
# - Create another variable called sum to calculate the addition of both numbers 
# - Initialize and assign the value 0 to them
# - Ask user to enter the two numbers
# - Store inputs to their respective variables
# - Add the two number and display the results


    # Andy Harris
# - create an integer variable for x
x = 0
# - create an integer variable for y
y = 0
# - create an integer variable for sum
sum = 0
# - ask the user "X: " and put answer in x
x = input("X: ")
# - ask the user "Y: " and put answer in y
y = input("Y: ")
# - convert x to integer
x = int(x)
# - convert y to integer
y = int(y)
# - put x + y in sum
sum = x + y
# - tell user "answer is " sum
print ("Sum is; ")
print (sum)
